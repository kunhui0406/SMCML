SMCML is a machine learningâ€“based predictive model designed to classify cellular subpopulations in murine atherosclerotic plaques and identify key marker genes.

We provide the core code based on the 160 optimal genes, including scripts for expression analysis, PAGA trajectory analysis, and model construction. 
The data folder contains the corresponding input datasets required to run these analyses.
